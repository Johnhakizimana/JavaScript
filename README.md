Over the past four weeks of learning JavaScript, 
we’ve covered many key concepts. 

In Week 1,we explored the basics like strings, variables, and operators.
In Week 2, we moved on to conditions, functions, if statements, and objects.
Week 3 introduced us to events and storage, helping us interact with users and save data.
Finally, in Week 4, we learned about asynchronous JavaScript and modern features. 
It’s been a challenging but rewarding journey!
